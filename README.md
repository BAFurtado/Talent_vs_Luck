##### This is a simple implementation of the Risk boardgame to study the separation between luck and talent (strategy)

To run the game and see a simulation, do:
`python game_on.py`

To run the game a number of time and record the results, do:
`python strategies.py`

You can adjust the number of times {m}. It does not take long to run 100,000 times. 

TODO
0. Test
1. Count number of goals
2. Save dice rolling
3. Think further about strategies
